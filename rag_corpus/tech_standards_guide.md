# Technology Standards and Decision-Making Guide

## Technology Standardization Framework

### Standard Categories

#### 1. Standard (Recommended)
Technologies that are enterprise-wide standards, fully supported, and preferred for new implementations.

**Criteria for Standard Status:**
- Industry-wide adoption and maturity
- Strong vendor support and roadmap
- Proven track record in enterprise environments
- Comprehensive documentation and community support
- Aligns with strategic technology direction

**Examples:**
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration standard
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
- **React**: Frontend framework standard
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage

#### 2. Tolerate (Conditionally Approved)
Technologies that are allowed for specific use cases but not recommended for general adoption.

**When to Use Tolerate Status:**
- Specialized requirements not met by standards
- Legacy system integration needs
- Proof-of-concept or experimental projects
- Vendor-specific functionality requirements

**Examples:**
- **MongoDB**: For document-specific use cases
- **Apache Kafka**: For high-throughput messaging
- **GraphQL**: For specific API requirements

#### 3. Retire (Deprecated)
Technologies that should be phased out and replaced with standards.

**Retirement Criteria:**
- End-of-life or security vulnerabilities
- Poor performance or scalability
- High maintenance costs
- Better alternatives available

**Examples:**
- **AngularJS**: End of life, security concerns
- **SOAP APIs**: Outdated protocol, security risks
- **Legacy monoliths**: High maintenance, poor scalability

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Technology Evaluation
When considering new technologies:

**Business Alignment**
- Does it support strategic business objectives?
- What is the business value and ROI?
- Are there regulatory or compliance implications?

**Technical Assessment**
- How does it compare to existing standards?
- What are the integration requirements?
- What is the learning curve for the team?

**Risk Analysis**
- Vendor stability and roadmap
- Security and compliance implications
- Performance and scalability characteristics

### 2. Exception Process
For technologies that don't meet standard criteria:

**Documentation Requirements**
- Business justification
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies
- Timeline for standardization

**Approval Process**
- EA review and approval
- Security team assessment
- Architecture review board sign-off

### 3. Technology Lifecycle Management

**Adoption Phase**
- Pilot implementation
- Team training and documentation
- Performance and security testing

**Maintenance Phase**
- Regular security updates
- Performance monitoring
- Vendor relationship management

**Retirement Planning**
- Migration strategy
- Data preservation requirements
- Timeline for decommissioning

## Implementation Guidelines

### Containerization Standards
- **Docker**: Standard container runtime
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **Helm**: Package management for Kubernetes
- **Container Registry**: Centralized image storage

### Database Standards
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **MongoDB**: Document database (tolerate)
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake or similar

### Frontend Standards
- **React**: Primary frontend framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Material-UI**: Component library
- **Redux**: State management

### API Standards
- **REST**: Primary API pattern
- **GraphQL**: For specific use cases (tolerate)
- **OpenAPI**: API documentation standard
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authentication standard

## Compliance and Security

### Security Requirements
- All technologies must meet security standards
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Secure development practices

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: Data privacy and protection
- **SOX**: Financial data integrity
- **ISO 27001**: Information security
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

## Monitoring and Governance

### Technology Portfolio Management
- Regular technology assessments
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Risk assessment updates

### Architecture Review Process
- Quarterly technology reviews
- Exception request processing
- Standards updates and communication
- Best practices documentation

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Standards
Always evaluate existing standards before considering new technologies.

### 2. Document Decisions
Maintain ADRs for all significant technology decisions.

### 3. Consider Total Cost
Include licensing, training, maintenance, and operational costs.

### 4. Plan for Evolution
Choose technologies with clear upgrade paths and vendor support.

### 5. Security First
Prioritize security and compliance in all technology decisions.

### 6. Team Enablement
Ensure team skills and training for chosen technologies.

### 7. Performance Validation
Test performance characteristics before production deployment.

### 8. Integration Planning
Plan integration with existing systems and data flows.

This guide provides the foundation for making informed technology decisions that align with enterprise architecture principles while maintaining flexibility for business needs.
