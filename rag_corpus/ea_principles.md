# Enterprise Architecture Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. Business Alignment
All technology decisions must directly support business objectives and capabilities. Technology investments should be justified by measurable business value and strategic alignment.

### 2. Standardization First
Prefer standard, widely-adopted technologies over custom solutions. Standards reduce complexity, improve maintainability, and enable better integration across the enterprise.

### 3. Security by Design
Security and compliance requirements must be integrated into all architecture decisions from the beginning, not added as an afterthought.

### 4. Data as an Asset
Treat data as a strategic enterprise asset with proper governance, quality standards, and lifecycle management.

### 5. Agility and Flexibility
Architectures should support rapid change and adaptation to business needs while maintaining stability and reliability.

### 6. Cost Optimization
Technology decisions must consider total cost of ownership, including licensing, maintenance, and operational costs.

### 7. Integration and Interoperability
Systems should be designed for integration and data sharing, avoiding silos and redundant data stores.

### 8. Scalability and Performance
Architectures must support business growth and performance requirements without major redesign.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating technology choices:
1. Assess business impact and alignment
2. Evaluate technical fit and standards compliance
3. Consider security and compliance requirements
4. Analyze total cost of ownership
5. Review integration and interoperability needs
6. Assess scalability and performance implications

## Governance

- All major technology decisions require EA review
- Architecture decisions must be documented in ADRs
- Regular architecture reviews ensure continued alignment
- Technology standards are reviewed quarterly
- Exceptions to standards require business justification
