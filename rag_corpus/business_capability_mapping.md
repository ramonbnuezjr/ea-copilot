## Capability-Application Mapping

### Mapping Methodology

#### 1. Capability Decomposition
Break down high-level capabilities into specific business processes and functions.

**Example: Customer Onboarding**
- Lead qualification and scoring
- Application processing
- Identity verification
- Account setup and activation
- Welcome and training

#### 2. Application Inventory
Document all applications with their primary and secondary capability support.

**Primary Support**: Direct capability enablement
**Secondary Support**: Indirect capability support

#### 3. Dependency Mapping
Identify application dependencies and data flows between capabilities.

**Data Dependencies**: Shared data and integration points
**Process Dependencies**: Sequential or parallel process flows
**Technology Dependencies**: Shared infrastructure and platforms

### Mapping Benefits

#### Strategic Planning
- Identify capability gaps and opportunities
- Prioritize application investments
- Align technology roadmap with business strategy
- Optimize portfolio composition

#### Operational Efficiency
- Reduce duplicate applications
- Optimize integration patterns
- Standardize common capabilities
- Improve data consistency

#### Risk Management
- Identify single points of failure
- Assess impact of application changes
- Plan disaster recovery strategies
- Manage vendor dependencies

## Portfolio Optimization
