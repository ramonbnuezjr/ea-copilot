# Improvements for EA Chatbot MVP

## âœ… 1. RAG Corpus - COMPLETED
- **Completed**: 9 comprehensive documents covering all major EA domains
- **Documents**: EA Principles, NFR Checklist, Technology Standards, Business Capability Mapping, Technical Debt Management, Cost Optimization, Data Governance, Integration Management, Architecture Decision Records
- **Total Content**: 166 document chunks, 78,756 characters
- **Quality**: Each document 500-800+ words with practical frameworks and best practices

## âœ… 2. Intelligent Mock Data - COMPLETED
- **Completed**: 12 comprehensive datasets with realistic distributions
- **Tech Standards**: Implemented 60% "tolerate", 30% "standard", 10% "retire" distribution
- **Risk Register**: Includes high-priority risks with severity and impact scoring
- **Cost/Licensing**: Contract renewal dates, vendor relationships, and cost optimization data
- **Cross-references**: Applications linked to capabilities, tech debt linked to systems

## âœ… 3. Vector Store & Embeddings - COMPLETED
- **Completed**: Full RAG retrieval system with ChromaDB
- **Embeddings**: Sentence transformers using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- **Chunking**: Intelligent 500-character chunks with 50-character overlap
- **Search**: Semantic search with relevance scoring and metadata tracking
- **Performance**: Successfully tested with 9 different query types

## ðŸ”„ 4. Reasoning Layer - IN PROGRESS
- **Next**: Integrate Gemini for inference with RAG grounding
- **Approach**: Use retrieved context to generate intelligent, grounded responses
- **Prompt Engineering**: Inject dataset context for richer answers

## ðŸ”„ 5. ServiceNow Alignment - PLANNED
- **Status**: Mock data mirrors ServiceNow EA taxonomy
- **Next**: Ensure capability mapping fits with ServiceNow's Business Capability Map
- **Integration**: Prepare for future ServiceNow API integration

## ðŸ”„ 6. Conversational Features - PLANNED
- **Status**: RAG system supports all planned query types
- **Next**: Implement impact queries, policy queries, and financial queries
- **Testing**: System successfully handles capability, technical, and compliance questions

## ðŸ”„ 7. Usability & Trust - PLANNED
- **Status**: RAG system provides document citations and source tracking
- **Next**: Implement mock metrics and dashboard-like responses
- **Trust**: All responses will be grounded in corpus documents

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: MVP Foundation Complete
The EA Chatbot now has a solid foundation with:
- Comprehensive knowledge base (9 documents, 166 chunks)
- Realistic mock data (12 datasets, cross-referenced)
- Fully functional RAG retrieval system
- Tested search and query capabilities

**Next Major Milestone**: Integrate Gemini AI for intelligent response generation
